You might&nbsp;be happy that they live in the comfort of their own house, where they have a sense of independence and security. On the other side, you may be continually concerned for their safety and well-being.

We\u2019re also providing recommendations on how to recognize when it\u2019s time to consider assisted living.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clear the Clutter<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Falls are the leading causal factor of injury among the elderly.

Since&nbsp;they can be safely placed on slippery, wooden floors, be sure that each rug has a slip-resistant rubber backing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Messy Cords and Wires Should Be Avoided \u2013<\/strong>&nbsp;Extending extension cables over the floor might be a significant problem. If they must be kept, attempt to conceal them with furniture or tape the cables&nbsp;to the floor using duct tape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep Your Elder\u2019s Home Clean<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes elderly people can have difficulty cleaning hard-to-reach areas in the bathroom, replacing air filters, or performing regular cleaning and maintenance. It can lead to health risks such as mold and dust, which can aggravate some health issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent this, make sure your elders\u2019 house is thoroughly cleaned at least once a month to avoid mold and dust from forming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep Emergency Number on Hand<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an emergency, your elderly may not be relaxed&nbsp;or technologically competent enough to pick up a phone number. To assist them, make a list of emergency numbers and contacts and put it somewhere easily&nbsp;accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maintain Stair Safety<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your elders\u2019 house includes stairs, ensure that the stairs&nbsp;are strong and safe, with no loose rails. Clear all clutter from the stairs and make sure there is enough illumination above the steps. When your parent has difficulty distinguishing between the stages, apply a strip of strikingly different colored&nbsp;tape on each one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is Time to Consider Assisted Living?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is vital for maintaining your parents\u2019 house as secure as possible, it\u2019s not always enough to keep them safe, cheerful, and healthy.
